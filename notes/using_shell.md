###Let's try a "mapreduce" problem solved in shell script!

So, this semester I've had some intro to Parallel Computing, Distributed Computing and Cloud Computing. Thus saying, I have used a little bit of Map Reduce and I found myself pretty fond of it. It's a great way do paralellize computing and work throught TeraBytes of information. But, of course, it has its own costs.

So, on my daily readings I found out this [entry](http://aadrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html) on a blog. Basically, it says that there are cases where a simple shell script program is 235x faster than a MapReduce implementation.

So... Let's try a shell script program and learn a little bit more about this toll, and see what it can give us.
